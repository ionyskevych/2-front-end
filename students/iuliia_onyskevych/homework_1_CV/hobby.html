            <h2 id="part1">El Camimo de Santiago</h2>
            <p>The Camino de Santiago (Also known as the Way of St. James) extends from different countries of 
             Europe, and even North Africa, on its way to Santiago de Compostela and Finisterre. The local 
             authorities try to restore many of the ancient routes, even those used in a limited period, in 
             the interest of tourism.</p>
            <p>The main pilgrimage route to Santiago follows an earlier Roman trade route, which 
             continues to the Atlantic coast of Galicia, ending at Cape Finisterre. Although it is known 
             today that Cape Finisterre, SpainI&apos;s westernmost point, is not the westernmost point of Europe 
             (Cabo da Roca in Portugal is farther west), the fact that the Romans called it Finisterrae 
             (literally the end of the world or LandI&apos;s End in Latin) indicates that they viewed it as such. At night, the Milky
             Way overhead seems to point the way, so the route acquired the nickname 
             <q>Voie lactée</q> – the Milky Way in French.</p>

            <h2 id="part3"><a href="#heder">&uArr;</a> Camino Frances</h2>
            <p>The Camino Frances or French Way is the most famous of all the Camino de Santiago routes,
             featuring in many documentaries, books, and movies such as <q>The Way</q> and <q>I&apos;ll Push You</q>.
            </p>
            <p>This Camino is an ancient pilgrim path across the North of the Iberian Peninsula,
             starting by the gorgeous red and white town of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port and finishing 
             in the holy city of Santiago de Compostela.
            </p>
            <p>The Camino Frances passes amazing cities and areas of natural beauty such as Pamplona,
             famous for its bull run; La Rioja wine region and its capital Logroño; Burgos with its 
             magnificent cathedral; elegant Leon and Ponferrada with its Templars Castle. 
             From Ponferrada, the Camino de Santiago enters Galicia through the mountains
              and picturesque village of O Cebreiro.
            </p>
            <p>The Camino de Santiago has been internationally 
            recognised as one of the historical symbols of European unity.
            The pilgrim route was chosen as the first European Cultural Route
            by the Council of Europe in 1987. The Camino and the architecture along its routes are
            also listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

            <h2 id="part4"><a href="#heder">&uArr; </a>Camino Portugues</h2>
            <p>The Camino Portugues Central or Portuguese Camino is a fantastic route for pilgrims looking for a more rural experience on the Camino de Santiago.
          This route is the route to Santiago traditionally chosen by pilgrims coming from Portugal, mainly from Lisbon and Porto. 
          Those two dazzling UNESCO WH cities still remain two of the main starting points for modern-day pilgrims on the Camino Portugues although you can start your 
          journey at any point along the way.
            </p>
            <p>It takes pilgrims across stunning countryside, villages, and towns such as Santarém, one of the last Moorish bastions in Portugal; 
          Coimbra, famous for its 13th-century university; and gorgeous Porto city with its colourful riverfront and home of Port wine. On the Spanish side, it will take you 
          passed past terraced fields, lush forests, vineyards, sleepy Galician villages. old Roman roads, across medieval bridges, lush forests, sleepy villages, vibrant towns 
          and historical cities as it heads North towards Santiago de Compostela. The small roads along the Camino Portugues also make it one of the best Camino routes for cycling.
          The history and heritage of the Camino is very much present along the way and you will encounter many churches, chapels, way crosses and shrines, where the image of Saint 
          James often offers comfort to pilgrims on their journey.
            </p>
            <p>The Camino Portugues Central follows the central Portuguese Camino all the way to Santiago, unlike the Camino Portugues Coastal, which splits from Porto and takes the
           coast way from there to Santiago. The Camino Portugues Way is a great option for pilgrims looking for a more rural walking experience on the Camino de Santiago.
           It is the second most popular Camino route but it doesn’t get as many pilgrims as the famous Camino Frances.The Camino Portugues Full Route takes just over one month to 
           complete or you can start at any different points along the way. The last 100km of the Camino Portuguese central route is the most popular section, with pilgrims starting their journey from Tui, Galicia, just across the Minho river from Portugal.

            <h2 id="part5"><a href="#heder">&uArr; </a>Camino Primitivo</h2>
            <p>Camino Primitivo or the Original Way is a part of the Northern Caminos network that includes Camino Primitivo, Camino del Norte (the Northern Way), and Camino Ingles (the English Way).
            </p>
            <p>The total distance of the Camino Primitivo 321km it can be completed in two weeks. The trail starts at the cathedral of Oviedo and finishes at the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. It’s considered to be the toughest out of all Camino de Santiago
         routes due to many steep up and down-hills. The route passes through two Spanish provinces – Asturias and Galicia and offers a great in-nature experience combined with good infrastructure. According to the statistics for 2019 only 4% (about 16 000
         people a year) of all the pilgrims who walk the Camino de Santiago choose the Primitive Way.
            </p>
            <p>Definitely, summer is the best time to do the Camino. It’s warm with fewer rainfalls though in the mountains the weather is unpredictable and changes quickly. July and August are the busiest months for this Camino with the best weather conditions.
         We walked this route end of May beginning of June and got quite a bit of rain though everybody told us it wasn’t normal usually it’s warm and sunny this time of the year.

            <h2 id="part6"><a href="#heder">&uArr; </a>Camino Finisterre</h2>
            <p>The Camino Finisterre or Camino de Fisterra is a unique route from Santiago to Cape Fisterra, believed to be the “Edge of the World”. This is the only trail starting in Santiago de Compostela and takes pilgrims West to the stunning Atlantic coast of Galicia.</p>
            <p>Over 4 days you will join many pilgrims in continuing their journey to the end of the Camino at Cap Finisterre (Fisterra). Once in Fisterra, enjoy a well-earned swim in the sea.</p>
            <p>For a really special experience, we recommend continuing for another 2 days, along the rugged coast to Muxia. This quaint fishing village is famed among pilgrims for its picturesque sanctuary of the Virgin by the ocean and ‘magic’ stones.</p>
